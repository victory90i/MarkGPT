# Linear Algebra Fundamentals for ML
## Comprehensive Learning Guide

## Vectors and Matrices

Vectors are ordered collections of numbers representing points in space.

Matrices are rectangular arrays of numbers organizing vectors into a grid structure.

Matrix transpose swaps rows and columns: (A^T)[i,j] = A[j,i].

Special matrices have unique properties: identity, diagonal, orthogonal matrices.

## Vector and Matrix Operations

The dot product measures similarity between vectors summing component-wise products.

Matrix multiplication combines dot products of matrix rows with columns.

Norms quantify vector magnitude: L2 (Euclidean), L1, and max norms are common.

Matrix norms extend vector norms: Frobenius norm, spectral norm for stretching.

## Solving Linear Systems

Linear systems appear constantly in ML: linear regression, constraints, equations.

Gaussian elimination is the foundation transforming systems to upper triangular form.

Least-squares solutions minimize error when exactly solving Ax = b is impossible.

The condition number measures sensitivity to perturbations indicating instability.


## Matrix Decompositions

QR decomposition factors matrix into orthogonal and upper triangular.

Cholesky decomposition works with symmetric positive-definite matrices.

LU decomposition factors into lower and upper triangular matrices.

Schur decomposition reveals matrix structure and stability.

Polar decomposition factors into unitary and positive-semidefinite.

Jordan decomposition helps understand matrix powers and exponentials.


## Applications in Machine Learning

Solving least squares problems efficiently with QR decomposition.

Computing determinants from LU for likelihood calculations.

Matrix exponentials appear in continuous-time models.

Kronecker products combine transformations in high dimensions.

Tensor operations extend linear algebra to higher-order tensors.

Vectorization tricks convert nested loops to matrix operations.


## Numerical Stability

Ill-conditioned matrices amplify small input perturbations.

Pivoting strategies improve numerical stability in algorithms.

Regularization adds small constants to diagonal for stability.

Iterative refinement improves solutions from direct methods.

Preconditioning accelerates convergence of iterative solvers.

Error bounds quantify how much rounding affects results.
