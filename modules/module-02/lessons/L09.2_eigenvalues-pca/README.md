# Eigenvalues and Principal Component Analysis
## Comprehensive Learning Guide

## Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Eigenvectors are special vectors only stretched without changing direction.

Eigenvalues reveal how much stretching happens in each eigenvector direction.

The characteristic polynomial det(A - λI) has roots equal to the eigenvalues.

Symmetric matrices have special properties enabling diagonalization and decomposition.

## Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)

SVD extends eigendecomposition to rectangular matrices: A = U @ Σ @ V^T.

Singular values measure how much the matrix stretches vectors in directions.

SVD reveals the rank of a matrix through non-zero singular values.

SVD simplifies many problems: least-squares, approximation, compression.

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA reduces dimensionality while preserving as much variance as possible.

Principal components are directions ordered by variance they capture.

Projecting onto principal components reduces dimensionality efficiently.

Practical PCA requires careful scaling and selection of component numbers.


## Advanced Dimensionality Reduction

Kernel PCA handles non-linear patterns unlike linear PCA.

Independent Component Analysis finds independent sources.

Factor Analysis models shared variance between variables.

Multidimensional Scaling preserves pairwise distances.

t-SNE visualizes high-dimensional data revealing clusters.

UMAP offers scalable alternative to t-SNE.


## Feature Selection Methods

Variance-based selection removes low-variance features.

Correlation-based selection removes highly correlated features.

Information-based selection uses mutual information.

Recursive feature elimination iteratively removes features.

Model-based selection uses feature importances from fitted models.

Wrapper methods evaluate subsets with cross-validation.


## Applications and Interpretability

PCA for visualization reduces to 2D or 3D for plotting.

PCA for noise reduction filters out small variance components.

Visualization of principal components reveals feature relationships.

Explained variance guides selection of component count.

Loadings show how original features contribute to components.

Score plots show projections of samples onto components.
