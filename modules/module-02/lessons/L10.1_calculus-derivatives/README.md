## Functions and Rates of Change

A function maps inputs to outputs and the derivative measures output change.

The derivative f'(x) is the limit of [f(x+h) - f(x)] / h as h approaches 0.

Higher derivatives measure changes in rates of change and curvature.

Partial derivatives extend to multiple variables measuring changes per variable.

## Optimization and Critical Points

Critical points are where the derivative equals zero: f'(x) = 0.

The second derivative reveals critical point types: minimum, maximum, saddle point.

Convex functions have at most one local minimum (the global minimum).

Gradient descent iteratively improves a solution by moving opposite the gradient.

## Advanced Optimization Concepts

Second-order methods use curvature information for faster convergence.

Newton's method uses the Hessian for convergence faster than gradient descent.

Quasi-Newton methods approximate the Hessian efficiently for large problems.

Understanding these methods accelerates your ability to optimize neural networks.


## Taylor Series and Approximation

Taylor series approximates functions using polynomial terms.

First-order approximation f(x) ≈ f(a) + f'(a)(x-a) is fundamental.

Second-order approximation adds curvature information.

Convergence of Taylor series depends on distance from expansion point.

Truncation error bounds quantify approximation accuracy.

Taylor series enables algorithm derivations.


## Multivariable Calculus

Gradient vectors point in direction of steepest increase.

Directional derivatives measure rate of change in any direction.

Hessian matrices contain all second partial derivatives.

Jacobian matrices contain first derivatives of vector functions.

Chain rule extends to functions of multiple variables.

Implicit differentiation handles equations without explicit solutions.


## Advanced Optimization Concepts

Constrained optimization handles problems with constraints.

Lagrange multipliers enable optimization with constraints.

KKT conditions generalize to inequality constraints.

Penalty methods convert constrained to unconstrained problems.

Barrier methods keep iterates strictly feasible.

Proximal methods handle non-smooth optimization problems.
