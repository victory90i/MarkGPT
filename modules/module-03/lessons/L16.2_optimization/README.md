## Batch Normalization Benefits

Batch normalization reduces internal covariate shift.

Normalized inputs to each layer improve stability.

Enables higher learning rates during training.

Reduces sensitivity to weight initialization.

Acts as regularizer reducing overfitting.

Becomes different during inference vs. training.

## Learning Rate Strategies

Constant learning rates rarely work well throughout training.

Cyclical learning rates alternate between high and low.

Warm restarts jump learning rate back up periodically.

OneCycle policy ramps up then down over single epoch.

Discriminative learning rates vary across layers.

Proper scheduling significantly impacts final performance.

## Gradient Accumulation

Accumulation enables larger effective batch sizes.

Useful when memory limits batch size.

Accumulate gradients over multiple forward/backward passes.

Update weights after accumulated gradient.

Increases training time but enables larger effective batches.

Reduces gradient noise improving convergence.


## Convergence Properties

Convexity ensures gradient descent reaches global optimum.

Non-convexity complicates optimization requiring good initialization.

Saddle point escape requires sufficient noise or second-order info.

Local minima often suffice in practice despite non-convexity.


## Learning Rate Strategies

Warm-up phases prevent divergence at training start.

Decay schedules reduce learning rate as training progresses.

Cyclical learning rates escape local minima periodically.

Adaptive schedules adjust rates per parameter based on gradients.
