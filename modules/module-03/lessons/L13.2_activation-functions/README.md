# Activation Functions for Neural Networks
## Comprehensive Learning Guide

## Linear Functions

Linear activation f(x) = x produces outputs proportional to inputs.

Linear activations fail to introduce non-linearity to networks.

Stacking linear layers is mathematically equivalent to a single layer.

Linear functions limit the network to learning linear relationships.

Deep networks with only linear activation reduce to shallow networks.

This motivates using non-linear activation functions.

## Sigmoid and Tanh Functions

The sigmoid function squashes values to range (0, 1).

Sigmoid was historically popular but suffers from vanishing gradients.

The tanh function maps values to range (-1, 1).

Tanh is zero-centered improving optimization over sigmoid.

Both suffer from gradient saturation at extreme values.

Modern networks prefer ReLU-based activations.

## ReLU and Variants

ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) is f(x) = max(0, x).

ReLU enables efficient computation with no exponential calculations.

ReLU helps avoid vanishing gradient problems in deep networks.

Leaky ReLU allows small negative gradients to prevent dead neurons.

ELU (Exponential Linear Unit) provides smooth negative values.

Variants improve training stability and network expressiveness.

## Modern Activation Functions

Swish (SiLU) is x * sigmoid(x) combining smoothness with efficiency.

GELU (Gaussian Error Linear Unit) uses cumulative Gaussian distribution.

Mish is x * tanh(softplus(x)) providing smooth non-linearity.

GLU (Gated Linear Unit) gates information flow through sigmoid.

Selection of activation impacts network capacity and training dynamics.

Different activations suit different problem types and architectures.


## Activation Function Properties

Non-linearity enables networks to approximate complex non-linear functions.

Differentiability requirement allows gradient-based optimization algorithms.

Boundedness prevents numerical instability and neuron saturation problems.

Output range affects learning dynamics and convergence properties.


## Function Comparisons

ReLU computational efficiency makes it standard for deep networks.

Sigmoid smoothness aids optimization but suffers vanishing gradients.

Tanh zero-centered outputs improve convergence over sigmoid.

Leaky ReLU prevents dying ReLU problem with small negative slope.
