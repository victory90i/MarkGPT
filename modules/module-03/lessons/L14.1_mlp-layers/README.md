## Comprehensive Learning Guide

## Fully Connected Layers

Fully connected layers connect every input to every output.

Each output neuron has separate weights and bias.

The output is y = activation(W*x + b) matrix multiplied input.

Fully connected layers are rich in parameters for flexibility.

Parameter count grows quadratically with layer sizes.

These layers form the basis of deep neural networks.

## Layer Composition and Architecture

Stacking multiple layers creates deep neural networks.

Each layer transforms the representation from previous layer.

Hidden layers learn intermediate features useful for prediction.

Network depth enables learning hierarchical representations.

Very deep networks require careful initialization and training.

Architecture design critically impacts learning capability.

## Network Capacity and Expressiveness

Wider networks have more parameters per layer.

Deeper networks compose more transformations.

Width and depth trade off computational cost and expressiveness.

Wider networks learn faster but need more data to generalize.

Deeper networks learn more abstract features.

Optimal architecture depends on dataset and problem.

## Vectorization and Efficiency

Batch processing passes multiple samples simultaneously.

Matrix operations leverage GPU acceleration efficiently.

Vectorization eliminates explicit loops over samples.

Batch size affects both speed and generalization.

Mini-batch processing balances computation and memory.

Efficient implementation critical for training large networks.


## Layer Design Principles

Width determines expressiveness matching problem complexity requirements.

Depth enables hierarchical feature learning from raw to abstract.

Universal approximation theorem guarantees sufficient width and depth.

Layer interaction through non-linearity creates feature hierarchies.


## Network Architecture

Bottleneck layers reduce dimensionality for feature compression.

Wide layers process large feature spaces enabling parallel computation.

Skip connections enable information flow in very deep networks.

Layer normalization stabilizes training independent of batch size.
