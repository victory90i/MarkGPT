# Regularization Techniques in Neural Networks
## Comprehensive Learning Guide

## Weight Regularization

L1 regularization (Lasso) encourages sparsity.

L2 regularization (Ridge) discourages large weights.

Elastic Net combines L1 and L2 penalties.

Weight decay in optimization approximates L2 regularization.

Regularization constrains model complexity.

Strength of regularization trades fit vs. simplicity.

## Early Stopping

Early stopping monitors validation performance during training.

Training stops when validation loss stops improving.

Prevents overfitting without explicit regularization.

Simple but effective approach to generalization.

Requires validation set separate from training.

Checkpoint best model during training.

## Data Augmentation

Augmentation artificially expands dataset through transformations.

Random crops, rotations, flips increase training diversity.

Mixup interpolates between samples and labels.

Cutmix mixes regions from different samples.

AutoAugment searches for optimal augmentation policies.

Effective augmentation enables training with less data.

## Advanced Regularization

Stochastic depth randomly drops layers during training.

MixUp and CutMix regularize through sample mixing.

Label smoothing prevents overconfident predictions.

Adversarial training improves robustness.

Mixup-based methods reduce memorization.

Combination of techniques provides best results.


## Regularization Mechanisms

L1 regularization encourages sparse weight solutions.

L2 regularization penalizes large weight magnitudes.

L1+L2 combination balances sparsity and weight decay.

Elastic net extends L1/L2 with additional parameters.


## Advanced Techniques

Early stopping halts training before overfitting.

Data augmentation artificially increases training set size.

Mixup interpolates samples and labels during training.

Cutout removes random image patches forcing robust learning.
