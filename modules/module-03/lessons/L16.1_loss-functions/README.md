# Loss Functions and Training Objectives
## Comprehensive Learning Guide

## Classification Losses

Cross-entropy loss measures divergence between distributions.

Softmax cross-entropy suits multi-class classification.

Binary cross-entropy applies to binary classification.

Focal loss addresses class imbalance in hard examples.

Hinge loss used in support vector machines.

Proper loss function choice affects convergence.

## Regression Losses

Mean squared error (MSE) penalizes large errors quadratically.

Mean absolute error (MAE) is robust to outliers.

Huber loss combines benefits of MSE and MAE.

Log-cosh loss is smooth approximation to L1 distance.

Quantile loss enables prediction of conditional distributions.

Loss choice reflects assumption about error distribution.

## Specialized Loss Functions

Contrastive loss learns similarity between samples.

Triplet loss enforces spacing in embedding space.

Siamese losses compare representations across samples.

Ranking losses optimize relative ordering of predictions.

Adversarial losses pit generator against discriminator.

Domain-specific losses encode problem structure.

## Loss Landscapes and Optimization

Loss landscape shape affects optimization difficulty.

Sharp minima generalize poorly to test data.

Flat minima suggest better generalization.

Asymmetry in loss landscape guides gradient descent.

Multiple local minima exist in high dimensions.

Understanding loss geometry improves training.


## Loss Design

Classification losses encourage correct class prediction.

Regression losses minimize prediction error magnitudes.
