## Tokenization Fundamentals

### What is Tokenization?

Converting text → tokens (numbers)
Token: Smallest unit (word, subword, character)
Required step for all NLP models
Quality crucial: Affects downstream tasks
Trade-off: Granularity vs vocabulary size

### Character-level Tokenization

Simplest: Each character = token
Alphabet size: 26 + digits + punct ≈ 100
Pros: Handles any text (misspellings, OOV)
Cons: Sequences very long, harder to learn
Example: "Hello" → [H,e,l,l,o]
Used in: Character-level language models

### Word-level Tokenization

Split on whitespace and punctuation
Vocab size: 10K-100K typical
Pros: Interpretable, reasonable length
Cons: OOV problem (unknown words)
Example: "Hello world!" → ["Hello", "world", "!"]
Problem: "hello" vs "Hello" = different tokens

### Subword Tokenization

Middle ground: Parts of words
Vocab size: 1K-100K
Examples: Byte-Pair Encoding, WordPiece
Balances word and character levels
Standard in modern NLP
"Hello" → ["He", "llo"] or ["Hel", "lo"]

## Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)

### Algorithm

1. Start with characters + special symbols
2. Count all adjacent pairs
3. Merge most frequent pair
4. Repeat until vocab size reached
Simple greedy algorithm
Very effective in practice

### BPE Example

Text: "hello hello"
Initial: [h,e,l,l,o, ,h,e,l,l,o]
Step 1: "l" "l" frequent → [h,e,ll,o, ,h,e,ll,o]
Step 2: "h" "e" frequent → [he,ll,o, ,he,ll,o]
Step 3: "he" "ll" frequent → [hell,o, ,hell,o]
Result: [hell, o, </s>, hell, o]

### BPE Advantages

Handles misspellings: "helo" → ["he", "lo"]
Compression: Frequent words = single token
Vocabulary: Finite size (predictable memory)
Language independent: Works on any language
Reversible: Can decode back
Reproducible: Same text → same tokens

## WordPiece Tokenization

### Differences from BPE

Merge criterion: Likelihood maximization
Not just frequency
Used in: BERT, RoBERTa
Similar results to BPE
Slightly different algorithm
Both work well in practice

## SentencePiece

### Language Agnostic

Works on raw text (no preprocessing)
No language-specific logic
Combines BPE and unigram language model
Treats space as token
Great for non-Latin scripts
Used in: T5, mBERT, many recent models

## Vocabulary Size Impact

### Small Vocab (1K)

Sequence length: Very long
Memory per sample: High
Training time: Slow
Parameter count: Lower (embedding matrix)
Typical: Character-level models

### Large Vocab (100K)

Sequence length: Short
Memory per sample: Low
Training time: Fast
Parameter count: Very high
Typical: BERT, GPT
Trade-off: Memory vs speed

## Special Tokens

### Standard Special Tokens

[CLS]: Classification token (start)
[SEP]: Separator (between sentences)
[PAD]: Padding (fill short sequences)
[UNK]: Unknown (OOV words)
[MASK]: Masked token (BERT pre-training)
</s>: End of sequence
<s>: Start of sequence

### Custom Tokens

Task-specific: [QUESTION], [ANSWER]
Entity types: [PER], [LOC], [ORG]
Domain-specific: [CODE], [EQUATION]
Improves performance
Requires fine-tuning
Common in production systems

## Handling OOV Words

### Problem

Word not in vocabulary → [UNK]
Loses information
Subword tokenization helps
"unrecognizable" → ["unrecognizable"]
BPE: ["unrecogniz", "able"]
Preserves information!

### Solutions

1. Subword tokenization (BPE, WordPiece)
2. Character-level fallback
3. Morphological analysis
4. Expand vocabulary
5. Back-off smoothing (pre-training trick)
Best: Combine approaches

## Tokenization Quality Metrics

### Compression Ratio

Average tokens per word
1.0: Perfect (1 token per word)
1.3: Good (3 tokens per 10 words)
2.0: Poor (half as many words)
Impact: Memory and compute
Typical: 1.1-1.3 for English

### Vocabulary Coverage

% of corpus tokens that are in-vocabulary
BERT (30K vocab): 98%+
GPT-2 (50K vocab): 99%+
Smaller vocab: Lower coverage
Affects performance
Trade-off: Size vs coverage

## Contextual Tokenization

### Problem: Ambiguity

"bank" = financial vs river bank
Single tokenization misses context
Morphologically: Same
Solution: Same token, different embeddings
Transformers learn contextual meaning

## Tokenization in Code

### Using HuggingFace

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained('bert-base')
tokens = tokenizer.encode('Hello world')
# [101, 7592, 2088, 102]
text = tokenizer.decode(tokens)
# 'Hello world'
```

### Custom Tokenizers

```python
from tokenizers import Tokenizer
from tokenizers.models import BPE

tokenizer = Tokenizer(BPE())
# Train on your data
tokenizer.train_from_iterator(texts, vocab_size=50000)
# Use it
encoding = tokenizer.encode('Your text')
```

## Multilingual Tokenization

### Challenges

100+ languages, different scripts
Chinese: Words not separated
Arabic: Right-to-left
Agglutinative: Turkish, Finnish
Solution: Universal tokenizers
SentencePiece: Language-agnostic

### mBERT Tokenization

Shared tokenizer across 104 languages
110K vocabulary
WordPiece trained on multilingual corpus
Works reasonably well
Trade-off: Per-language quality
Enables zero-shot cross-lingual transfer

## Tokenization Speed

### Practical Performance

BERT tokenizer: 10K tokens/s
SentencePiece: 100K tokens/s
Character-level: 1M tokens/s
Bottleneck: Usually data loading
Cache tokens during preprocessing
Pre-tokenize for speed

## Preprocessing Pipeline

### Best Practices

1. Normalize: Lowercasing (task-dependent)
2. Remove: Accents, special chars (careful!)
3. Tokenize: Use standard tokenizer
4. Truncate: Limit length
5. Pad: Make same length for batching
6. Convert to IDs: Vocabulary lookup

## Tokenization Errors

### Common Issues

1. **Case sensitivity**: "Hello" ≠ "hello"
   Solution: Lowercase before tokenizing

2. **Punctuation**: Attached vs separate
   Solution: Check tokenizer behavior

3. **Contractions**: "don't" → [
   Solution: Expand or handle in tokenizer

4. **Whitespace**: Multiple spaces
   Solution: Normalize whitespace

## Vocabulary Learning

### From Unlabeled Data

Train on large corpus
No labels needed
Learn frequent patterns
Adapt to domain
Example: Train on Wikipedia → Reddit
Learn Reddit-specific slang

## Word Embeddings Fundamentals

### What are Word Embeddings?

Dense vectors representing words
Dimension: 50-300 typical
Learned from large text corpus
Similar words → similar vectors
Foundation of modern NLP
Input to neural networks

### Distributional Hypothesis

"You shall know a word by the company it keeps"
Context determines meaning
Words in similar contexts → similar meanings
Learning principle: Co-occurrence statistics
Basis for all embedding methods
Remarkably effective!

### Embedding Dimension

50D: Very small, fast, limited expressiveness
100D: Minimal, basic tasks
300D: Standard for word embeddings
1000D: Large, rich, slow
Larger: More expressive, more parameters
Typical: 300D word2vec, 768D BERT

## Word2Vec

### Skip-gram Model

Predict context from word
Input: Center word
Output: Surrounding words (window)
Loss: Cross-entropy
Objective: Maximize P(context|word)
Simple but powerful

### CBOW (Continuous Bag of Words)

Opposite of Skip-gram
Input: Context words
Output: Center word
Faster to train
Better for frequent words
Generally worse performance than Skip-gram

### Negative Sampling

Problem: Softmax over entire vocabulary
Huge vocabulary: 1M+ words
Computing softmax: O(V)
Solution: Negative sampling
Sample K negative examples
Loss: Binary classification (positive vs negatives)
10-15x speedup!

### Hierarchical Softmax

Alternative to negative sampling
Binary tree of vocabulary
Log depth ≈ log(V)
Each path: Binary decisions
Faster than full softmax
Slower than negative sampling
Used in some implementations

### Word2Vec Training

1. Initialize embeddings randomly
2. Iterate through corpus
3. For each word-context pair:
   - Compute output probability
   - Compute loss
   - Update embeddings
4. Repeat multiple epochs
Convergence: ~10-20 billion words

### Analogies: Additive Property

"king - man + woman ≈ queen"
Vector arithmetic works!
v(king) - v(man) + v(woman) ≈ v(queen)
Shows semantic structure
Not always perfect
Remarkable emergent property

### Why it Works

Skip-gram objective: Embed words
Minimize distance for similar contexts
Words in similar positions → close vectors
Unsupervised learning from corpus statistics
No manual annotations needed
Scales to huge corpora

## GloVe (Global Vectors)

### Motivation

Word2Vec: Local context only
GloVe: Combine local and global
Use word co-occurrence matrix
Factor matrix → embeddings
Linear transformation
Faster training than Word2Vec

### Co-occurrence Matrix

Count how often words co-occur
X_ij = count(word_i near word_j)
Huge and sparse: V x V
100K vocab: 10 billion entries!
Solution: Only store non-zeros
Factorize: X ≈ W @ W^T

### GloVe Objective

Weighted least squares:
L = Σ_ij f(X_ij) (w_i . w_j - log X_ij)^2
f(X_ij): Weight function
Prevents rare co-occurrences dominating
Closed form optimization possible
Faster convergence than Word2Vec

### GloVe vs Word2Vec

GloVe: Explicit global statistics
Word2Vec: Implicit via optimization
GloVe: Typically better (slightly)
Word2Vec: Simpler, faster
Both: Great in practice
Modern: Transformers replace both

## fastText

### Subword Vectors

Problem: Word2Vec can't handle OOV
Solution: Learn character n-gram embeddings
Word = sum of character n-grams
v(hello) = v(he) + v(el) + v(ll) + v(lo) + ...
Handles unseen words!
Handles morphology

### Character N-grams

Typical: 3-6 character n-grams
"hello" (n=3): [hel, ell, llo]
"hello" (n=4): [hell, ello]
"hello" (n=5): [hello]
Plus special markers for word start/end
Sum: Gives word embedding

### fastText Training

1. Compute character n-gram vectors
2. Word vector = sum of n-grams
3. Train like Word2Vec (Skip-gram)
4. Learn both: word vectors and n-grams
5. At inference: Can compute for OOV

Handling spelling: Similar n-grams

### fastText Language Support

Multilingual: 176+ languages
Pre-trained vectors available
Works great for morphologically rich
Turkish, Finnish, Czech, etc.
Better than Word2Vec for these
Practical advantage for low-resource

## Embedding Visualization

### t-SNE Projection

300D embedding → 2D visualization
Non-linear dimensional reduction
Preserves local structure
Shows word clusters
Similar words close together
Beautiful emergent structure

### UMAP

Uniform Manifold Approximation
Faster than t-SNE
Preserves global structure better
Two parameters: n_neighbors, min_dist
Good for large embedding sets
Can scale to millions of vectors

## Training Embeddings

### Using gensim

```python
from gensim.models import Word2Vec

model = Word2Vec(sentences, size=300, window=5)
vec = model.wv['hello']
similar = model.wv.most_similar('king')
```

### Using fastText

```python
import fasttext
model = fasttext.train_unsupervised('data.txt')
vec = model.get_word_vector('hello')
```

## Pre-trained Embeddings

### When to Use Pre-trained

Limited data: Always use
Data on same domain: Cold-start faster
Transfer learning: Few examples needed
Stability: Better than random init
Typical: Download from model zoos
Fine-tune on task data

### Domain Specificity

Generic (Wikipedia): Good baseline
Medical (PubMed): Better for medical
Code (GitHub): Better for code
Domain adaptation: Fine-tune
Task-specific: Train from scratch if big data
Usually: Domain > task-specific

## Embedding Evaluation

### Intrinsic Evaluation

Word analogies: King - man + woman = queen
Similarity correlation: Compare to human ratings
Relatedness tasks: RareWord, SimLex
Direct measure of embedding quality
Fast to compute
Not always predictive of downstream

### Extrinsic Evaluation

Downstream task performance
Text classification
Named entity recognition
Sentiment analysis
Best predictor of real usefulness
But: Slower and task-dependent

## Embedding Training Tips

### Hyperparameters

Size (dimension): 100-300 typical
Window size: 2-15 (larger = preserves syntax)
Negative samples: 5-15
Epochs: 5-30 (more if larger corpus)
Learning rate: Usually 0.025 default
Minimum count: 5, drop rare words

### Dataset Size

Small (1M words): Overfitting risk
Medium (100M words): Good quality
Large (1B+ words): Best quality
Diminishing returns after 1B
Typical: Train on crawled web text
Wikipedia (3.5B words): Excellent base

### Computational Efficiency

Word2Vec: O(V) with negative sampling
Can train on single machine
100M words: Minutes
1B words: Hours
Parallel training: Multiple threads
Fast compared to deep learning

## Contextualized Embeddings

### Static vs Dynamic

Static (Word2Vec): Same vector for all contexts
Dynamic (ELMo, BERT): Different per context
Problem with static: "bank" is ambiguous
ELMo: First dynamic method (2018)
Revolution in NLP
Transition to transformers

## Common Mistakes

### Don't

- Train on tiny corpus (<100K words)
- Use embedding size > 500 without need
- Ignore OOV problem
- Fine-tune randomly (use pre-trained)
- Ignore domain mismatch
- Train embeddings from scratch if data limited

### Do

- Use pre-trained when possible
- Match embedding dim to task
- Fine-tune on task data
- Evaluate on downstream tasks
- Consider subword (fastText) for OOV
- Use contextualized for modern tasks

## Embedding Arithmetic

### Word Analogies

Task: a is to b as c is to d
Find d: d ≈ b - a + c
Example: Paris - France + Germany = Berlin
Remarkable: Works surprisingly well
Emergent property of vector space
Not always accurate but conceptually rich

### Semantic Relationships

Synonyms: Similar vectors
Antonyms: Opposite vectors
Hypernyms: Generalization direction
Part-of: Also somewhat reflected
Relational properties: Encoded implicitly
Remarkable unsupervised learning!

## ELMo: Embeddings from Language Models

### The Great Insight (2018)

Hidden states encode rich information
Use as embeddings instead of words
Different representation per context
Solves word sense disambiguation
Revolutionized NLP in 2018

### Architecture

Bidirectional LSTM language model
Forward LSTM: Left to right
Backward LSTM: Right to left
3 layers: Input + 2 hidden
Each token: Multiple representation options
Combine all: Weighted sum of layers

### Training

Language modeling task:
Predict next token given context
Unsupervised: Only need text
Scale: 1B token corpus
Result: Rich contextual representations
Weights: Learned task-specifically

### Usage

1. Pre-train LSTM language model
2. Extract hidden states for token
3. Concatenate/weight combinations
4. Use as features for downstream
5. Fine-tune weights on task
Simple layer-weighting learned

### Results

NER: +2% F1 on CoNLL
Sentiment: +1-2% accuracy
QA: +2-3% on SQuAD
Consistent improvements
Modest but reliable gains
Foundation for BERT

### Limitations

Unidirectional for future context

ELMo: First contextual (2018)
BERT: Bidirectional contextual
GPT: Autoregressive contextual
Modern requirement

### Layer-wise Analysis

Lower layers: Syntax (POS, chunking)
Middle layers: Low-level semantics
Upper layers: High-level (task-specific)
Transfer learning exploits this
Fine-tune upper layers for task
Freeze lower for general knowledge

## Dimensionality Reduction

Embeddings capture both
Lower layers: More syntactic
Attention patterns reveal structure
Can probe for structure

### Probing Tasks

Train classifier on hidden states
Predict POS tags from embeddings
If high accuracy: Encodes POS
Multiple properties simultaneously
Trade-off: Information vs capacity
Reveals learned representations

## Morphology

### Morphological Analysis

Words have structure
Stems and affixes
"Running" = "run" + "-ing"
Embeddings somewhat capture
More explicit: Morphological models
Helps low-resource languages

### Morphologically Rich Languages

Turkish: Agglutinative (many suffixes)
Finnish: Very complex
Czech: Many cases
Arabic: Root patterns
Challenges: Many word forms
fastText helps via subword

## Domain Adaptation

### The Problem

Train on Wikipedia (general)
Test on biomedical (specific)
Distribution shift
Generic embeddings miss domain
Solution: Adapt embeddings
Or train model on domain

### Approaches

1. Retrain on domain corpus
2. Fine-tune general embeddings
3. Domain-specific vocabulary
4. Combine with domain knowledge
5. Active learning: Query hard examples
Typically: Fine-tune + domain vocab

## Data Augmentation

### Backtranslation

Translate to another language
Translate back to original
Creates paraphrases
Double data size
Improves robustness
Common for small datasets

### Synonym Replacement

Replace words with synonyms
EDA: Easy Data Augmentation
Random and controlled
Preserves label but varies text
Simple baseline
Works surprisingly well

### Mixup and Cutoff

Mixup: Linear combination of embeddings
Cutoff: Drop random tokens/subwords
Regularization via augmentation
Helps with small datasets
Modern practice

## Low-Resource NLP

### Transfer Learning

Pre-train on general (billions tokens)
Fine-tune on task (thousands examples)
Much better than training from scratch
50-story/0-shot with good model
Modern necessity
Enables low-resource work

### Few-Shot Learning

Learn from very few examples
5-10 labeled examples
Meta-learning approaches
MAML: Model-agnostic meta-learning
Prototypical networks
Enables rapid adaptation

### Zero-Shot Learning

No labeled examples
Use class descriptions
Match to class semantic vectors
Requires good embeddings
Prompt-based approach
Emerging with large models

## Handling Imbalanced Data

### Class Imbalance

90% negative, 10% positive
Accuracy misleading
Always predict majority
Accuracy: 90% but useless!
Need: Balanced metrics

### Solutions

1. Oversampling: Duplicate minority
2. Undersampling: Drop majority
3. Cost-sensitive: Penalize errors
4. SMOTE: Synthetic minority examples
5. Threshold tuning: Adjust decision
6. Use better metrics: F1, RoC-AUC

## Error Analysis

### Systematic Analysis

1. Look at wrong predictions
2. Categorize error types
3. Count by category
4. Focus on top errors
5. Address root causes
Better than tuning:
Understanding > parameters

### Confusion Matrix

TP: True Positive
FN: False Negative (missed)

## Active Learning

### Selective Labeling

Don't label everything
Label most informative examples
Model-uncertain examples
Reduces annotation cost
20% labels → 90% of full accuracy
Smart data collection

### Query Strategies

Uncertainty: Model least confident
Diversity: Examples unlike labeled
Expected gradient length: Big gradient
Committee: Ensemble disagreement
Typical: Start with diverse, refine uncertain

## Interpretability

### Feature Attribution

Which words matter for prediction?
Gradient-based: ∂L/∂x
Attention: Which words attended?
LIME: Local explanations
SHAP: Game theory-based
Understanding models is crucial

### Adversarial Robustness

Small input changes flip prediction
Spelling errors: "resteraunt"
Paraphrases: Change wording
Typos: Should be robust
Adversarial training helps
Data augmentation helps

## Production Deployment

### Model Serving

Model trained - now what?
API endpoint for predictions
Batch processing for bulk
Real-time requirements
Infrastructure: Docker, Kubernetes
Monitoring: Accuracy, latency

### Edge Cases

Empty input: Handle gracefully
Very long text: Truncate intelligently
OOV words: Use subword fallback
Multiple languages: Route to language-specific
Malformed: Preprocess carefully
Production requirement

### Monitoring and Metrics

Accuracy: Baseline metric
Latency: Response time
Throughput: Requests/sec
Cost: Computational efficiency
Drift: Does performance degrade?
User feedback: Ground truth check

### Updating Models

Data changes over time
Retraining schedule
A/B test: New vs old model
Gradual rollout: 1% → 10% → 100%
Rollback: If issues detected
Continuous improvement

## Dataset Construction

### Annotation Guidelines

Clear definitions
Examples with explanations
Disagreement resolution
Quality control
Inter-annotator agreement
Cohen's kappa metric

### Crowdsourcing

Hire many annotators
Low cost per example
Redundancy for quality
Platforms: Mechanical Turk, Upwork
Worker qualification
Often enables large-scale

### Dataset Biases

Selection bias: Who collected?
Labeler bias: Subjective decisions
Distribution: Representative sample?
Can affect model fairness
Audit datasets routinely
Better: Diversify sources

## Benchmarking

### Important Benchmarks

GLUE: 9 language understanding tasks
SQuAD: Reading comprehension
MNIST: Classic (simple now)

Common measures: Compare fairly
Leaderboards: Competitive drive

### Benchmark Gaming

Overfitting to benchmark
Not generalizing
Contamination: Test in training?
Solution: New datasets, real applications
Better metric: Few-shot on new task
Robust evaluation needed

## Computational Efficiency

### Model Size

BERT-base: 110M parameters
BERT-large: 340M parameters
Inference: Larger = slower
Mobile: Need lightweight
DistilBERT: 40% smaller, 97% accuracy
Pruning: Remove unimportant weights

### Quantization Revisited

FP32 → FP16: 2x faster
FP32 → INT8: 4x faster, 1% loss

Startup cost matters sometimes

## Responsible AI

### Fairness

Demographic parity: Same accuracy
Equalized odds: Similar errors
Calibration: Confidence = accuracy
Bias detection: Audit models
Mitigation: Better data, constraints
Ongoing work

### Privacy

Memorization: Models can memorize
Membership inference: Can extract training data?
Differential privacy: Formal guarantee
Federated learning: Train on device
Data retention: Keep only needed
Regulation: GDPR, local laws

### Transparency

Model cards: Document model
Data sheets: Document data
Limitations: Be honest
Failure cases: When it breaks
