## Static Embeddings Analysis

### Pre-trained vs Trained

Pre-trained: Leverage general knowledge
Task-specific: Better on target
Fine-tune: Improve pre-trained
Frozen: Use as-is
Trade-off: Data size vs pre-training

### Embedding Drift

Words change meaning over time
"gay" historically = happy
Embeddings capture era language
Temporal analysis possible
Historical text vs modern

### Sense Embeddings

Multiple senses per word
"bank": financial/river
Mixture model approach
Per-sense embeddings
Disambiguate from context

### Retrofitting

Post-hoc refinement
Adjust embeddings to resources
Preserve similarity structure
Add external knowledge
Better semantic alignment

### Morphological Composition

"unhappy" = "un" + "happy"
Compositional model
Predicts morphologically rich
Helps low-resource
Shares structure

### Frequency Band Analysis

Common words: Stable embeddings
Rare words: Noisy embeddings
Frequency affects quality
Regularization helps rare
Inverse frequency weighting
