# GPT and Language Model Pretraining
## Comprehensive Learning Guide

## Transformer Architecture

Transformers use self-attention for context.

Parallel processing enables efficiency.

Positional encoding captures sequence order.

Multi-head attention models diverse relationships.

Feed-forward networks increase expressiveness.

Layer normalization stabilizes training.

Residual connections improve gradient flow.

## Language Model Pretraining

Next token prediction provides learning signal.

Causal attention prevents future information access.

Large text corpora provide training data.

Unsupervised learning requires no annotations.

Emergent capabilities appear with scale.

In-context learning enables few-shot performance.

Instruction tuning improves usability.

## GPT Capabilities

Text generation produces coherent sequences.

Few-shot learning adapts quickly.

Prompt engineering guides model behavior.

Chain-of-thought improves reasoning.

Instruction following enables task specification.

Knowledge stored implicitly in parameters.

Scaling laws predict performance with size.

## Advanced Language Models

Temperature and top-k sampling control generation diversity.

## Autoregressive vs Bidirectional

### Autoregressive (GPT)

Generate left-to-right
P(w_t | w_1, ..., w_{t-1})
Natural: Text generation
Can't see future
Used by GPT, GPT-2, GPT-3

### Bidirectional (BERT)

P(w_t | all words except w_t)
Can see both directions
Better for classification
Can't generate naturally
Used by BERT, RoBERTa

### Masked Language Model

[MASK] token in input
Predict what's masked
Bidirectional context
Allows both directions
BERT pre-training task

### Next Sentence Prediction

Predict if B follows A
Related sentences: Yes
Random sentences: No
Binary classification
BERT auxiliary task

### Scaling Laws

Performance improves predictably
Loss ∝ 1 / (model_size)
Doubling size: ~5% better
10x compute: ~30% better
Drives gigantic models

## Fine-tuning Strategies

### Task-Specific Fine-tuning

Adapt general model to task
Add task-specific head
Fine-tune all or last layers
Much faster than pre-training
Works with limited data

### Domain Adaptation

Further pre-train on domain
Medical text on medical papers
Code on code repositories
Cheap pre-training phase
Significant quality improvement

### Few-shot Learning

Show examples in context
No parameter updates
In-context learning
Larger models better
GPT-3: Few-shot phenomena

### Prompt Engineering

Design input prompts
"Translate English to French:\n"
Huge impact on output
Task description format
Active research

### Temperature and Sampling

Temperature: Higher = more random
Top-k: Sample from top k
Top-p: Sample from top p prob
Nucleus sampling: Balanced
Controls output diversity

### Tokenizer Impact

Different tokenizers = different results
BPE variants: GPT uses BPE
Token count affects length
Encoding efficiency
Multilingual challenges

## Decoder-Only Models

### Causal Attention Mask

Can't see future tokens
Preserves autoregressive property
Triangular attention matrix
Efficient in Transformer
Enables generation

### Positional Encodings

Sinusoidal: sin/cos patterns
Learnable: From scratch
RoPE: Rotation-based
Relative position: Many variants
Affects position sensitivity

### Batch Normalization vs LayerNorm

BatchNorm: Across batch dimension
LayerNorm: Across features
Transformers use LayerNorm
More stable training
Better for variable lengths

### Gradient Checkpointing

Memory vs compute trade-off
Recompute forward passes
Reduce memory by ~33%
Slightly slower
Essential for large models

### Mixed Precision Training

FP32 for stability
FP16 for speed/memory
4x memory savings
2-3x speedup
Nvidia AMP implementation
