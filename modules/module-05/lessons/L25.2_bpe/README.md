# Byte Pair Encoding and Subword Tokenization
## Comprehensive Learning Guide

## BPE Algorithm

Byte Pair Encoding learns vocabulary from data.

Frequent character pairs merge into single tokens.

Iterative merging builds hierarchical vocabulary.

Merge operations preserve frequency information.

Final vocabulary balances coverage and size.

BPE enables handling rare words effectively.

Shared vocabulary reduces storage requirements.

## Subword Mechanisms

Subword units handle out-of-vocabulary words.

Unknown words decompose into known subwords.

Character awareness enables spelling patterns.

Morphological patterns emerge from subwords.

Language transfer improved through shared tokens.

Vocabulary size controls parameter count.

Token sequences represent rare words accurately.

## Vocabulary Construction

Initial vocabulary contains characters and special tokens.

Merge frequency determines vocabulary growth.

Rare merges dropped to prevent overfitting.

Frequency threshold controls final size.

Deterministic merging enables reproducibility.

Vocabulary learned separately per language.

Multilingual vocabulary supports cross-lingual models.

## BPE Variants and Optimizations

SentencePiece learns BPE on character and word levels.

WordPiece uses likelihood criterion for merging.

Unigram language model selects vocabulary probabilistically.
