## The Attention Formula

Attention lets a model weigh the importance of different input tokens when computing representations. It computes a weighted sum of values, where weights are derived from the compatibility of queries and keys.

Understanding attention is crucial to demystifying how transformers work.

## Debug Tip

When implementing attention, verify that your attention weights sum to 1 across the sequence dimension (after softmax). This helps catch shape mismatches and numerical instability early.
