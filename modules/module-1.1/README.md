3. **Reinforcement Learning** - Learning through interaction and reward signals

### What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Instead of following pre-defined rules, ML models learn patterns from data and use these patterns to make predictions or decisions.

Machine Learning has become fundamental to modern technology, powering applications from recommendation systems to autonomous vehicles. Understanding the core concepts and algorithms is essential for any data scientist or AI engineer.

### Goals of This Module

## Data Preparation & Feature Engineering

### Why It Matters
Data quality and features are often more important than the algorithm choice. Organizations typically spend 60-80% of time on data preparation and feature engineering.

### Data Preparation Best Practices
- **Handle Missing Values**: Understand why data is missing (MCAR, MAR, MNAR)
- **Detect Outliers**: Use statistical methods (IQR, Z-score) or domain knowledge

- Document why specific metrics were chosen

## Cross-Validation and Testing Strategies

### Why Cross-Validation Matters
Cross-validation provides more reliable performance estimates by using multiple train-test splits rather than a single split, which may not be representative of model performance.

### Cross-Validation Techniques
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Divide data into k equal parts, train k models
- **Stratified K-Fold**: Preserve class distribution in each fold
- **Time Series Split**: Respect temporal ordering in time-series data
- **Leave-One-Out Cross-Validation**: Use one sample for testing, rest for training
- **Nested Cross-Validation**: Separate validation for hyperparameter tuning

### Proper Train-Test Split Strategy
- **Training Set** (60-70%): Used for model training
- **Validation Set** (10-15%): Used for hyperparameter tuning
- **Test Set** (15-30%): Final evaluation, touched only once
- **Temporal Ordering**: For time-series, split chronologically
- **Stratification**: Preserve class distributions in splits

### Avoiding Evaluation Pitfalls
- Never tune hyperparameters on test set
- Don't report metrics from training data as final performance
- Use random states for reproducibility
- Account for data leakage between sets
- Document your cross-validation strategy

## Hyperparameter Tuning

### Understanding Hyperparameters
Hyperparameters are configuration settings chosen before training that control how the learning algorithm behaves. Unlike model parameters learned from data, hyperparameters define the learning process itself.

### Common Hyperparameter Tuning Methods
- **Grid Search**: Exhaustive search over specified parameter values
- **Random Search**: Random sampling of parameter space
- **Bayesian Optimization**: Probabilistic model-based search
- **Genetic Algorithms**: Evolution-inspired optimization
- **Hyperband**: Successive halving for faster tuning

### Hyperparameter Tuning Best Practices
- Start with default values and understand their impact
- Use domain knowledge to set reasonable ranges
- Tune hyperparameters using validation set, not test set
- Search coarse-to-fine for efficiency
- Parallelize search for faster computation
- Document optimal values for reproducibility
- Consider computational budget when choosing search strategy

### Common Hyperparameters by Algorithm
- **Tree-based**: tree depth, min samples split, number of trees
- **Linear Models**: regularization strength (C, alpha), solver type
- **SVM**: kernel type, C parameter, gamma
- **Neural Networks**: learning rate, batch size, number of layers
- **Clustering**: number of clusters, initialization method

## Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them

### Interpretation Mistakes
- **Mistake**: Assuming correlation implies causation
  - **Fix**: Understand the difference; use proper statistical tests
- **Mistake**: Overgeneralizing from model performance
  - **Fix**: Test on diverse, representative data

## The Bias-Variance Tradeoff

### Understanding Bias and Variance

**Bias** refers to systematic errors from oversimplified assumptions in the model. High bias models underfit, failing to capture the underlying patterns in data.

**Variance** refers to sensitivity to fluctuations in the training data. High variance models overfit, memorizing noise rather than learning patterns.

### Identifying Bias-Variance Issues

**High Bias (Underfitting)**
- Training error is high
- Validation error is also high
- Training and validation errors are similar
- Model is too simple for the problem

**High Variance (Overfitting)**
- Training error is low
- Validation error is much higher than training error
- Large gap between training and validation error
- Model is too complex for available data

### Strategies to Address Imbalance

**For Underfitting (High Bias)**
- Use more complex model architecture
- Add more features or polynomial features
- Reduce regularization strength
- Increase model training duration
- Collect more diverse data

**For Overfitting (High Variance)**
- Use simpler model architecture
- Add regularization (L1, L2, dropout)
- Collect more training data
- Perform feature selection
- Use early stopping
- Increase dropout rate for neural networks

### The Bias-Variance Tradeoff in Practice
The goal is to find the sweet spot where total error (bias + variance + irreducible error) is minimized. This often requires experimentation with different model complexities.
