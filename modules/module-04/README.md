## Recurrent Neural Networks - Fundamentals

### What is a Recurrent Network?

Standard feedforward: x → h → output
Recurrent: x_t → h_t → output_t
h_t depends on x_t AND h_{t-1}
Hidden state carries information from past.

Processing sequences: One element at a time
Weights shared across time steps (parameter efficiency).
### Hidden State and Time Unrolling

h_t = tanh(W_h @ h_{t-1} + W_x @ x_t + b)
o_t = W_o @ h_t + b_o

Time unrolling: Unfold RNN for T time steps
Creates deep feedforward network (depth = sequence length)
Backprop through time (BPTT): Chain rule across time.

## Sequence to Output

### Many-to-One (e.g., sentiment)

Input: Sequence of 100 words
Process: Apply RNN at each step
Output: Only use final h_T for classification
Loss computes only on last output.
Gradient flows backward through all steps.

### One-to-Many (e.g., image captioning)

Input: Single image
Process: Encode to h_0
Output: Generate caption word by word
h_0 from CNN → fed to RNN
Each RNN step outputs word token.

### Many-to-Many (e.g., NER, machine translation)

Input: Sequence of N tokens
Process: RNN processes all
Output: Sequence of N predictions
Each time step has input and output.
Examples: Sequence labeling, translation.

## The Vanishing Gradient Problem

### The Issue

BPTT: Chain rule multiplies gradients
∂L/∂h_0 = (∂L/∂h_T) * (∂h_T/∂h_{T-1}) * ... * (∂h_1/∂h_0)
Each ∂h_t/∂h_{t-1} < 1 typically
Product of T < 1 terms → exponentially small
Gradient for h_0 becomes nearly 0.

### Why This Matters

Early inputs get negligible gradients.
Model forgets distant past (effective window ~5-20 steps).
Long-range dependencies can't be learned.
Example: Pronoun in position 1, reference at position 50.
RNN unlikely to learn this dependency.

### Exploding Gradients (Opposite Problem)

If ∂h_t/∂h_{t-1} > 1:
Product of T > 1 terms → exponentially large
Gradients overflow to NaN/Inf
Training becomes unstable.
Less common than vanishing but worse when it happens.

## Solutions: Gradient Clipping

### The Fix

Gradient norm clipping:
if ||∇|| > threshold:
  ∇ = ∇ * (threshold / ||∇||)
Rescales large gradients.
Prevents explosion.
Threshold: 1.0 or 5.0 typical.

### Implementation

Compute gradients as usual.
Compute L2 norm: sqrt(sum of g^2).
If norm > max_norm: rescale.
Apply update.
Handles both explosion and (partially) vanishing.

## Solutions: Better Activation Functions

### ReLU in RNNs

tanh: Saturates, derivative → 0
ReLU: Linear on positive side, derivative = 1
Helps gradients flow better.
But can have dying ReLU problem.
ELU/GELU: Smooth, no saturation.

## Simple RNN Implementation

### Core Loop

```python
class SimpleRNN:
  def forward(self, X):  # X: (T, batch, input_dim)
    h = zeros((batch, hidden_dim))
    outputs = []
    for t in range(T):
      h = tanh(X[t] @ Wx + h @ Wh + bh)
      out = h @ Wo + bo
      outputs.append(out)
    return stack(outputs)
```

### Backpropagation Through Time

```python
def backward(self, grad_output):  # (T, batch, out_dim)
  dWx, dWh, dWo = 0, 0, 0
  dh_next = 0
  for t in reversed(range(T)):
    dh = (grad_output[t] @ Wo.T + dh_next)
    dWo += h[t].T @ grad_output[t]
    dh = dh * (1 - h[t]**2)  # tanh derivative
    dWx += X[t].T @ dh
    dWh += h[t-1].T @ dh
    dh_next = dh @ Wh.T
```

## Truncated Backpropagation

### Motivation

Full BPTT through entire sequence → slow
Backprop only through last k steps
Practical compromise: Efficient + reasonably good
k values: 20-50 steps typical
Still captures local temporal dependencies.

## Weight Initialization

### Why It Matters

Poor init: Gradients vanish/explode from start
Good init: Preserve signal variance across layers
Key: Keep ||h_t|| roughly constant
Var(h_t) ≈ Var(h_{t-1})

### Orthogonal Initialization

Initialize Wh as orthogonal matrix
Properties: Preserves vector norm
Eigenvalues = 1 (no growth/decay)
Prevents gradient explosion/vanishing initially.
Recommended for RNNs.

## Bidirectional RNNs

### Motivation

Forward RNN: Process left to right
Backward RNN: Process right to left
Concatenate outputs: [h_fwd; h_bwd]
Access context from both directions.
Improves performance on tagging tasks.

### Architecture

Input sequence: [w1, w2, w3, w4]
Forward pass: → → → →
Backward pass: ← ← ← ←
Output at t: [fwd_h_t; bwd_h_t]
Dimension: 2 * hidden_dim

## Peephole Connections

### With RNN

Standard: h_t = f(W @ [x_t; h_{t-1}])
No dependency on cell state (in basic RNN).
Gradient flow during forward pass constrained.

## Sequence Padding and Masking

### Variable Length Sequences

Real sequences: Different lengths
Batch processing: Need same length
Solution: Pad short sequences
Padding token: 0 (special index)
Sequence lengths: Store actual lengths

### Masking

During forward: Process padded positions
During loss: Ignore padded positions
Loss = sum(loss[i] * mask[i]) / sum(mask)
Prevents gradients from padding tokens.
Attention:  Mask with -inf (softmax → 0).

## Common RNN Patterns

### Encoder-Decoder (No Attention)

Encoder: Process input → final h_T
h_T: Summary of entire input
Decoder: Initialize with h_T, generate output
Limitation: All info in single vector
Better approach: Use attention (module-05).

### Autoregressive Generation

At test time: Generate one token at a time
Use own output as next input
Temperature: Control randomness
Sampling vs beam search tradeoffs
Exposure bias: Train vs test mismatch.

## Practical Considerations

### Sequence Length

Very long sequences: Truncated BPTT
Typical: 50-512 tokens
Maximum: GPU memory constraint
Tradeoff: Longer = more context, slower training

### Batch Size

Standard: 32-128
Affects gradient estimate quality
Memory per sequence * batch_size
Typical GPU: batch_size=64 for seq_len=512
Larger batch = noisier gradients

## Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

### The Cell State Innovation

Key insight: Separate cell state from hidden state
c_t: Cell state (internal memory)
h_t: Hidden state (external output)
Cell state acts like "conveyor belt"
Gradient can flow without vanishing.

### Gates: Forget, Input, Output

Three gating mechanisms:
1. Forget gate: f_t = sigmoid(W_f @ [h_{t-1}; x_t] + b_f)
   Controls what to discard from c_{t-1}
2. Input gate: i_t = sigmoid(W_i @ [h_{t-1}; x_t] + b_i)
   Controls what new info to add
3. Output gate: o_t = sigmoid(W_o @ [h_{t-1}; x_t] + b_o)
   Controls what to expose from c_t

### Cell State Update

Candidate cell state:
c̃_t = tanh(W_c @ [h_{t-1}; x_t] + b_c)

Cell state update:
c_t = f_t ⊙ c_{t-1} + i_t ⊙ c̃_t
⊙ denotes element-wise multiplication

Hidden state:
h_t = o_t ⊙ tanh(c_t)

### Gradient Flow Through Cell State

∂c_t / ∂c_{t-1} = f_t (Hadamard product)
f_t values in (0, 1) but not multiplication of many terms
Much better gradient flow than standard RNN
Allows gradients to propagate 100+ steps
Solves vanishing gradient problem!

### LSTM Advantages

Long-range dependencies: Can learn 100-200 step dependencies
Forget gate: Can selectively discard info
Input gate: Can control what to remember
Output gate: Can control what to reveal
Trade-off: 4x parameters vs standard RNN

## GRU: A Simpler Alternative

### Motivation

LSTM: 4 gates, complex, many parameters
Can we simplify?
GRU: 2 gates, simpler, 3x fewer parameters
Similar performance on most tasks

### GRU Gates

Reset gate: r_t = sigmoid(W_r @ [h_{t-1}; x_t] + b_r)
Controls how much of h_{t-1} to use

Update gate: z_t = sigmoid(W_z @ [h_{t-1}; x_t] + b_z)
Controls how much of new info vs old

Candidate state:
h̃_t = tanh(W @ [r_t ⊙ h_{t-1}; x_t] + b)

Final state:
h_t = (1 - z_t) ⊙ h_{t-1} + z_t ⊙ h̃_t

### LSTM vs GRU

LSTM: Better with complex patterns
GRU: Faster, fewer parameters
Empirically: Often similar performance
Use GRU: When compute is limited
Use LSTM: When data is abundant
Modern trend: Transformers replace both

## Stacked RNNs

### Multiple Layers

1D: Single RNN layer
2D: Stack 2 RNN layers
Output of layer 1 → input of layer 2

Deep encoders: 2-4 layers beneficial
Each layer computes higher-level features
Example: Word embeddings → syntax → semantics

Parameters: L * layers
Training time: ~L * slower

### Residual Connections in RNNs

Very deep RNNs: Training becomes hard
Add skip connections: x_{l+2} = f(x_{l+1}) + x_l
Enables training 4+ layer RNNs
Helps gradient flow
Used in cutting-edge models.

## Attention in RNNs

### Problem: Bottleneck

Encoder outputs h_T (single vector)
Must contain all input information
Problematic for long sequences (100+ tokens)
Solution: Use all h_1, h_2, ..., h_T

### Attention Mechanism

Query: Decoder state s_t
Keys: Encoder states h_1, ..., h_T
Values: Encoder states h_1, ..., h_T

Score: e_t,j = v^T @ tanh(W_s @ [s_t; h_j])
Weights: α_t,j = softmax(e_t,j)
Context: c_t = Σ α_t,j @ h_j

Output: decoder processes [s_t; c_t]

### Multiplicative Attention

Simpler form (used in transformers):
Score: e_t,j = (s_t @ h_j) / sqrt(d)
No learned parameters in scoring
Just dot product + softmax
Scale by 1/sqrt(d) for stability
Very efficient!

## Bidirectional LSTM

### Design

Forward LSTM: Process left to right
Backward LSTM: Process right to left
Outputs: [fwd_h_t; bwd_h_t]
Cannot be used for generation (needs input sequence end)
Great for tagging, classification

## PyTorch/TensorFlow LSTM Usage

### PyTorch

```python
lstm = nn.LSTM(input_size, hidden_size, num_layers,
               batch_first=True, bidirectional=True)
outputs, (h_n, c_n) = lstm(x)  # x: (batch, T, input_size)
# outputs: (batch, T, 2*hidden if bidirectional)
# h_n: (num_layers*2, batch, hidden) if bidirectional
# c_n: (num_layers*2, batch, hidden)
```

### TensorFlow

```python
lstm = tf.keras.layers.LSTM(hidden_size, return_sequences=True)
outputs = lstm(x)  # x: (batch, T, input_size)
# outputs: (batch, T, hidden_size)
# For last output: outputs[:, -1, :]
# Bidirectional: Bidirectional(LSTM(...))
```

## Encoder-Decoder with Attention

### Architecture

Encoder: Bi-LSTM reads input sequence
Outputs: h_1, h_2, ..., h_T
Decoder: LSTM generates output
Each step: Attends to encoder outputs
Completely parallelizable (replaced by Transformers)

### Context Vector

Each decoder step:
1. Query from decoder state
2. Compute attention weights over all encoder outputs
3. Weighted sum of encoder outputs
4. Concatenate with decoder input for next step
Very powerful (translation baseline ~30 BLEU).

## Common Practices

### Dropout

Apply to:
- Input x_t
- Between LSTM layers
- NOT between time steps (breaks temporal coherence)
Typical rate: 0.3-0.5
Prevents overfitting on small datasets

### Learning Rate

RNNs very sensitive to learning rate
Start with 1e-3
If diverges: Lower to 1e-4
Use gradient clipping (max_norm=5.0)
Warmup beneficial: Linear increase first 5% steps

## Practical Tips

- Start with 2 layers, expand if needed
- Hidden size: 128-512 typical
- Sequence length: 32-256 for NLP
- Longer = more memory, smaller batches
- Check gradient flow: norms should be O(0.1-1.0)
- Monitor validation loss during training
- Save checkpoint with best validation

## Attention Variants

### Additive (Bahdanau) Attention

Score: e = v^T @ tanh(W @ concat([query, key]))
Learnable combining function
More expressive than dot-product
Higher computational cost
Earlier method (2014), still effective

### Scaled Dot-Product Attention

Score: e = query @ key / sqrt(d_k)
No learned parameters
O(n^2) complexity (acceptable for n<512)
Scaling prevents saturation in softmax
Foundation of Transformer architecture
Preferred in modern systems

### Multi-Head Attention

Concatenate multiple attention heads
Head i: Attend to different feature subsets
Benefits: Attend to different positions, semantic meanings
Typical: 8-16 heads
Total params same as single head
h(Q,K,V) = concat(head_1, ..., head_h) @ W^O

### Sparse Attention

Full attention: O(n^2) memory
Sparse: Attend only to local window
Block-sparse: Attend to blocks
Enables longer sequences
Trade-off: Some long-range dependencies lost

### Self-Attention

Query, Key, Value all from same sequence
Each position attends to all positions
Captures positional relationships
Foundation for Transformers
Used in BERT, GPT, etc.

## Transformers: The Game Changer

### Motivation

RNN/LSTM: Sequential, hard to parallelize
Transformers: Fully parallelizable
2017: "Attention is All You Need" paper
Became foundation of modern NLP
100x more efficient training

### Encoder Architecture

1. Multi-head self-attention
2. Feed-forward network
3. Layer normalization
4. Residual connections
Repeat 12-96 times (layers)

Each layer increases semantic understanding
Lower: Syntax, Upper: Semantics

### Postional Encoding

Problem: Attention doesn't know position
Solution: Add positional pattern
PE(pos, 2i) = sin(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
PE(pos, 2i+1) = cos(pos / 10000^(2i/d_model))
Encodes both absolute and relative position
Allows extrapolation to longer sequences

### Feed-Forward Network

2-layer MLP between attention
Expands: d_model → d_ff → d_model
d_ff = 4 * d_model typical
Applied position-wise (all tokens independently)
ReLU activation
Adds non-linearity, capacity

### Layer Normalization

Before 2020: Pre-LN (norm before sublayer)
After 2020: Post-LN (norm after)
Pre-LN: Easier to train deep networks
Post-LN: Slightly better final performance
Modern: Usually Pre-LN
Normalizes each sample independently

### Decoder with Cross-Attention

Self-attention: On target sequence
Cross-attention: On encoder outputs
Causality: Can't attend to future tokens
Masked attention: Mask future positions to -inf
Enables generation one token at a time

## Sequence-to-Sequence with Transformers

### Training

Encoder: Process full source
Decoder: Process full target (during training)
Loss: Cross-entropy on target tokens
Efficiency: Fully parallel, train in hours not days
MarkGPT: Uses this architecture

### Inference

Encoder: Process source (once)
Decoder: Generate token by token
Feed own output as next input
Stop: Until EOS token
Beam search: Track multiple hypotheses
Temperature: Control randomness

## Attention Analysis

### Visualization

Heatmap: Attention weights
X-axis: Keys (what to attend to)
Y-axis: Queries (who's attending)
Color: Weight magnitude
Reveals learned patterns
Early layers: Local patterns
Late layers: Long-range dependencies

### Interpretability

What does attention attend to?
Head 1: Syntactic relationships
Head 2: Semantic relationships
Head 3: Position information
Useful but not ground truth
Single value doesn't explain decision

## Language Modeling

### Task Definition

Predict next token given context
P(w_t | w_1, ..., w_{t-1})
Unsupervised pretraining
Foundation for fine-tuning
GPT trained this way

### Perplexity

Measures model uncertainty
PP = 2^(cross-entropy)
Lower is better
PP=100: Like choosing from ~100 equally likely tokens
MarkGPT: Achieves 8-15 on different domains
Baseline: 50-100 typical

Transformers great for structured output
Context modeling crucial

## Common Training Tips

### Batch Size

Larger batch: Better gradient estimate
Smaller batch: Faster feedback loop
Typical: 16-64 for classification
Typical: 32-256 for LM
Memory: Scales with batch_size * seq_len

### Learning Rate Schedules

Linear warmup: 0 → LR over 10% steps
Then constant: Stay at LR
Or decay: cos(...) decreasing
Warmup prevents divergence
Decay helps convergence
Half life: 50K steps typical

### Regularization

Dropout: 0.1 in attention, FFN
Weight decay: 0.01 typical
Label smoothing: 0.1 (soften targets)
Data augmentation: Back-translation
Early stopping: Monitor validation

### Checkpointing

Save model every N steps
Keep best (by validation metric)
Enable recovery from failure
A/B testing different configs
Typical: Save every 1000 steps
Keep 3-5 recent checkpoints

## Inference Optimization

### Batching

Process multiple samples simultaneously
GPU utilization: 5% → 90%
Batch size: Trade-off latency vs throughput
Typical: Batch 32-64 for low latency
Batch 256+ for throughput

### KV-Cache

During generation, recompute all steps
KV-cache: Store K, V from previous
Compute only for latest token
Trade-off: Memory for compute
7B model: ~30GB cache for batch=32
Worth it: 10x speedup

### Quantization

FP32 → INT8 or INT4
Model size: 4x smaller
Inference: 2-3x faster
Accuracy: 1-5% loss (varies)
INT4: More aggressive, ~10% loss
Worth exploring for deployment

## Multi-GPU Training

### Data Parallelism

Same model on N GPUs
Each GPU: Different batch
Sync gradients after backward
Linear speedup (mostly)
Easy to implement

### Distributed Training

Multiple nodes, multiple GPUs
NCCL: Efficient GPU communication
NVLink: Fast inter-GPU bandwidth
Scaling: 8 GPUs → 8x speedup (95%)
Scaling: 64 GPUs → 50x speedup (78%)
Communication overhead increases

## Debugging Guide

### Check Data Loading

Print sample batch
Verify shapes
Check for NaN/Inf
Verify tokenization
Look for label issues

### Check Model Forward Pass

Pass single batch
Print all activation shapes
Check for NaN/Inf
Monitor gradient flow
Gradient should be O(0.001 - 0.1)

### Training Diagnostics

Loss not decreasing: LR too small
Loss diverges: LR too large
NaN in loss: Overflow, reduce LR
Train >> val: Overfitting
Train ≈ val: Good generalization

## Hyperparameter Reference

**Model Size**
Hidden: 256-4096
Layers: 2-96
Heads: 4-32
FFN: 4*hidden typical

**Training**
Learning rate: 1e-5 to 1e-3
Batch size: 8-4096
Warmup: 5-10% of total steps
Weight decay: 0.0-0.1
Dropout: 0.0-0.3

## Common Pitfalls

1. **Learning rate too high**
   → loss diverges to NaN
   → reduce by 10x

2. **Learning rate too low**
   → loss barely decreases
   → increase, use warmup

3. **Sequence length too long**
   → OOM (out of memory)
   → reduce, use gradient checkpointing

4. **Batch size too small**
   → noisy gradients, unstable
   → increase if memory allows

## ResNets in Transformers

### Residual Connections

x → block_1 → + → LayerNorm → block_2 → +
Enables very deep networks (96 layers)
Gradient flows through skip connection
Each layer: Additive update
Without residuals: Very hard to train deep

## Layer Normalization Details

### Why LN not BatchNorm

BatchNorm: Normalize across batch
LayerNorm: Normalize across features
Transformers use LayerNorm
Independent of batch size
Works better for variable lengths
More stable numerically

## Vocabulary and Tokenization

### Byte-Pair Encoding (BPE)

Start: All bytes (256 tokens)
Merge: Most frequent pair
Repeat: Until vocab size reached
Result: Subword tokens
Typical vocab: 50K tokens
MarkGPT: Uses custom BPE

### Sentence Piece

Similar to BPE
Works directly on text
No need for initial word split
Better for non-Latin scripts
Used in many models
Example: spaCy, BERT

## Memory Efficiency

### Model Size

7B params in FP32: 28GB
7B params in FP16: 14GB
7B params in INT8: 7GB
Typical GPU: 24GB
So must use quantization or LoRA

## Practical Deployment

### Production Considerations

1. Inference latency: <100ms typical
2. Throughput: 100+ req/sec
3. Cost: GPU hours, model storage
4. Reliability: 99.9% uptime
5. Monitoring: Accuracy, latency, errors
6. Updates: New model versions
7. Compliance: Data privacy, bias

## Testing and Evaluation

## Advanced Optimization Techniques

### Gradient Accumulation

Simulate larger batch without OOM
Process N small batches, accumulate gradients
Update every N steps
Effect: Same as batch_size * N
Ideal for sequences with large token count

### Mixed Precision Training

Master weights in FP32 (stability)
Computation in FP16 (speed)
Loss scaling: Multiply by 2^16 (prevent underflow)
Result: 2-3x speedup, <1% accuracy loss
Essential for large models

### Gradient Checkpointing

Trade: Compute for memory
Forward: Don't save activations
Backward: Recompute as needed
Memory: O(√N) instead of O(N)
Speed: ~30% slower
Worth it for batch_size doubling

### Lookahead Optimizer

Keep K slow weights, N fast weights
Fast updates: Normal gradient descent
Slow updates: Every K fast steps
Benefits: More stable, better generalization
Less sensitive to learning rate

### Layer-wise Learning Rates

Lower layers learn slower (foundation)
Higher layers learn faster (task-specific)
BERT fine-tuning: 0.1-0.5 ratio
Example: Lower LR 1e-5, upper LR 1e-4
Better transfer learning

### Warmup Strategies

Linear warmup: 0 → LR over fraction of steps
Helps optimization stability
10% of total steps typical
Alternatives: Square root, exponential
Important for transformers especially

### Learning Rate Scheduling

Constant: Simple baseline
Linear decay: Decrease linearly
Cosine: cos(π * t / T) shaped
Step: Decay every N steps
Exponential: Exponential decay
Empirically: Cosine ≈ linear, both good

### Weight Decay & L2 Regularization

Standard L2: Add 0.5 * λ * ||w||^2 to loss
AdamW: Decouple weight decay from gradient
Weight decay ≠ L2 with adaptive optimizers!
Typical λ: 0.01-0.1
Prevents overfitting

### Label Smoothing

One-hot target: [0, 1, 0, 0]
Smoothed: [0.01, 0.91, 0.01, 0.01] (with ε=0.1)
Prevents overconfidence
Regularization effect
Typical ε: 0.1
Improves generalization

## Interpretability Deep Dive

### Probing Tasks

Train classifier on hidden states
If high accuracy: Layer encodes feature
Example: Predict POS from h_t
Result: Earlier layers = syntax, later = semantics
Reveals learned representations

### Saliency Maps

∇ L / ∇ x: Input gradient
Magnitude: How much input affects output
Visualization: Color heat map
Interpretation: Which tokens matter
Caveat: Not always meaningful for text

### Attention Head Analysis

Query-key dot products
Visualize as heatmap
Pattern 1: Attending to next token
Pattern 2: Attending to same position
Pattern 3: Positional patterns
Interpretable but not complete story

### SHAP Values

Game theory approach
Shapley value: Fair feature contribution
Expensive to compute (combinatorial)
Approximations exist (SHAPATTY)
Gold standard for interpretability

### Influence Functions

Which training examples help/hurt?
Trace gradient backward in Hessian
Computationally expensive
Useful for data debugging
Find adversarial examples

## Domain Adaptation

### Covariate Shift

Train and test: Different input distribution
Example: Medical text differs from typical
Solution: Importance reweighting
Or: Continued pre-training on target

### Domain-Adaptive Pre-training

DAPT: Further pre-train on target domain
10K-100K steps on unlabeled target
Then fine-tune on task
Improves +5-10% on small fine-tuning sets

### Task-Adaptive Pre-training

TAPT: Pre-train further on task data
Only 100 steps sufficient
Very effective for low-resource tasks
Can beat full fine-tuning of generic model

### Few-Shot Learning

Meta-learning: Learn to learn
MAML: Model-agnostic meta-learning
Update parameters for few examples
Learn good initialization
Enables fast adaptation

## Multilingual Models

### mBERT Design

104 languages in single model
Shared vocabulary across languages
WordPiece tokenization
110K tokens total (vs 30K monolingual)
Trade-off: More tokens, covers more

### Cross-lingual Transfer

Train on English, test on Hindi
Transfer quality: 80%+ on many pairs
Magic: Shared embedding space
Better with similar languages
Enables low-resource NLP

### Language-specific Fine-tuning

Start: mBERT (multilingual)
Fine-tune: On target language data
Effect: Specialize to language
Performance: Often better than monolingual
Due to multilingual pre-training signal

## Continual Learning

### Catastrophic Forgetting

Train on task A
Fine-tune on task B
Performance on A: Drops to 10%
Weights: Optimized away from A
Challenge: Maintain both

### Elastic Weight Consolidation

Compute parameter importance
Fisher information matrix
Penalize changing important params
Loss = task_loss + λ * Σ F_i * (θ_i - θ_old)^2
Achieves 80%+ on both tasks

### Replay Methods

Keep some examples from task A
Mix with task B during training
Simple: Just replay
Effective: Prevents catastrophic forgetting
Memory-efficient: Store embeddings not raw data

### Parameter Isolation

Different tasks: Different parameters
Adapters: Task-specific modules
Sparse masks: Select per task
Complete isolation: No interference
Trade-off: More storage (LoRA helps)

## Adversarial Training

### Adversarial Examples

Small input perturbation
Flips model prediction
Example: Change 1-2 words
Model thinks should change sentiment
Shows model brittleness

### Defense: Adversarial Training

Generate adversarial examples
Augment training data
Train on both natural + adversarial
Result: Robust to perturbations
Cost: ~3x slower training

## Uncertainty Quantification

### Model Confidence

Max softmax: Simple but miscalibrated
Better use: Temperature scaling
Output prob / T where T ≈ 1.5
Helps calibration
On OOD data: Confidence no good

### Bayesian Deep Learning

Uncertainty over weights
Variational inference
Approximation: MC Dropout
Forward pass N times, average
Get uncertainty from variance
Expensive but principled

### Out-of-Distribution Detection

Detect when input unusual
Methods: Max probability, energy-based
Mahalanobis distance: Distance from training
Useful for safety-critical systems
Important for production deployment

## Efficiency: Model Distillation

### Knowledge Distillation

Large teacher → small student
Student learns soft targets from teacher
Temperature: Soften distribution
T=3-20 typical
Result: 100M student = 90% of 7B teacher

### Architecture Distillation

Distill BERT-large → BERT-small
6 layers instead of 12
Result: 40% smaller, 90% accuracy
Student matches teacher logits + attention
ALBERT: Parameter sharing in layers

### Task-specific Distillation

Distill-BERT: Fine-tune then distill
Results: 2-4x faster inference
Minimal accuracy loss
Great for production
Can stack multiple distillations

## Efficiency: Quantization

### Post-training Quantization

Train: FP32
Quantize: INT8/INT4 after
Fastest: No retraining
Accuracy: 0.5-2% loss (INT8), 10%+ (INT4)
Easy to implement

### Quantization-Aware Training

Simulate quantization during training
Model learns robust representations
INT4 with QAT: 5% loss vs 25% PTQ
Training time: 2x
Worth it for deployment

### Mixed-bit Quantization

Different bits per layer
Attention: INT8
FFN: INT4
Balance: (int4 gradual decrement)
Result: Optimal size-accuracy trade-off

## Efficiency: Pruning

### Magnitude Pruning

Remove weights with small magnitude
Simple to implement
Result: 30-50% sparsity
Inference: Hard to accelerate (unstructured)
Better with hardware support

### Structured Pruning

Remove entire neurons/channels
Hard to determine importance
Methods: Lottery ticket, fisher pruning
Result: 40-60% speed improvement
Can achieve 10:1 compression

### Lottery Ticket Hypothesis

Initialize, train, prune, reset
Pruned network (lottery ticket) ≈ trained!
Key: Right initialization + pruning mask
Explains why networks over-parameterized
Can prune 90%+ and still work

## Multimodal Architecture

### Vision Transformers

Split image into patches
Linear projection to embeddings
Apply standard transformer
Comparable to CNNs for classification
Better for downstream tasks

### CLIP: Image-Text

Contrastive learning
Image encoder and text encoder
Maximize: sim(image, caption)
Result: Zero-shot classification
Foundation for image search

### Speech-to-Text
