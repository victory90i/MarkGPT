# Dot-Product Attention and Scaling
## Comprehensive Learning Guide

## Dot-Product Mechanism

Dot product measures similarity between vectors efficiently.

Query vector matched against all key vectors.

Large dot products indicate high similarity and relevance.

Softmax converts dot products to probability distribution.

Attention weighted output combines relevant values.

Differential gradient flow enables end-to-end training.

## Scaling and Normalization

Large dimensions cause dot products to become very large.

Large values saturate softmax yielding vanishing gradients.

Dividing by sqrt(dimension) prevents saturation.

Proper scaling maintains reasonable activation ranges.

Softmax normalization ensures probabilities sum to one.

Temperature scaling adjusts attention sharpness.

## Efficiency and Performance

Dot-product attention highly parallelizable with matrix ops.

GEMM operations efficiently computed on GPUs.

Additive attention requires feed-forward network per query.

Dot-product faster but potentially less expressive.

Attention output dimension affects memory and compute.

Sparsity pruning reduces attention computation further.

## Optimization and Variants

Low-rank attention approximation reduces parameters.

Kernel methods approximate attention with features.

Flash attention optimizes memory access patterns.

Grouped query attention shares key-value across queries.

Multi-query attention further reduces parameters.

Sliding window attention limits memory quadratic growth.

Efficient attention implementations exploit sparsity.
