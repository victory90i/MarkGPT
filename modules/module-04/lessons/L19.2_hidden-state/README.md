# Hidden State and Recurrent Computation
## Comprehensive Learning Guide

## Hidden State Mechanics

Hidden state vector encodes temporal context and memory.

State is updated at each time step based on input and previous state.

Hidden dimension determines capacity for information storage.

State initialization affects early predictions and learning.

State is shared across all time steps enabling parameter efficiency.

Final state summarizes entire sequence information.

## Recurrent Updates

Recurrent equation combines previous state with new input.

Non-linear activation enables complex temporal patterns.

State update is deterministic function of input and previous state.

Multiple layers stack recurrent computations for hierarchy.

Bidirectional processing uses forward and backward passes.

State reset between sequences separates independent examples.

## Information Flow

Information propagates forward through time in unfolded graph.

Gradients propagate backward through time for learning.

Early timesteps influence final prediction through state.

Context mixing blends information from all time steps.

Bottleneck state constrains information capacity.

Attention mechanisms focus on relevant time steps.

## Advanced State Representations

Auxiliary task learning improves state representation quality.

State clustering reveals emergent structure in learned representations.

Adversarial state training hardens against perturbations.

State importance reveals which dimensions encode information.

Factorized representations decompose state into independent factors.

Sparse state updates reduce computational overhead.

State prediction losses improve feature learning.
